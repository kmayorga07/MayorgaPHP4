# MayorgaPHP4
Using PHP to give a response after inputting an option.

Title: How did you hear about us?

Purpose: The idea behind this program is to allow the user to click one of the options in the dropdown list to respond to the age old questions you saw above in the title. 

Instructions: The user has to select one option. Once one of the options is entered and submitted, the program will send back a unique response to your browser. Move on to the next program and you will notice a similarity. The question is the same and the responses are also similar; the only difference is that I used a Switch statement instead of If/Else statements.

The last program: The 3rd and final program is just a bonus, it has nothing to do with the first two programs and it was created to have a little fun using nested for loops. Enjoy :)
